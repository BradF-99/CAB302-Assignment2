\section{Statement of Completeness}

The solution includes the following features: 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Line} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Plot} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Rectangle} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Ellipse} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Polygon} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Pen Colour} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Fill Colour} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{File Handling - Read} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{File Handling - Write} & Still to be implemented \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Layout} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Buttons} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Menu Bar} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Colour Picker} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Additional - Undo History} & Still to be implemented \\
		\hline  \textbf{Additional - Bitmap Export} & Still to be implemented \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
By the due date, we were able to complete 100\% of the essential requirements and 2 additional requirements - being Undo History, and Bitmap Export.

\section{Statement of Contribution}

{\large Alex Butler}\\
Alex implemented all of the Shape classes, as well as the Shape interface and enumerator. He also wrote the unit tests for testing each Shape class, and the first iteration of the GUI (mainly for testing purposes). 
\\\\{\large Bradley Fuller}\\
Bradley implemented the file handling classes, as well as the unit testing for said classes. He also wrote and configured the Apache Ant build script, and the TravisCI configuration for continuous integration and delivery to GitHub Releases.
\\\\{\large Joshua O'Riordan}\\
Joshua implemented the final iteration of the GUI, including the general layout, buttons, menu bar and colour picker. He also wrote the Undo History and Bitmap Export functionality, as well as the unit tests for both.

\section{Software Development Practices}

Add our development practices and cycles here. Describe how the team used Agile Development Processes. If you used test-driven development, describe this here. Otherwise, describe other relevant processes (e.g. iterative design-code-test stages).

Both Agile and TDD style processes were used in the development of this project.

The team utilised Agile's philosophy of iterative and incremental changes, through the use of continuous integration and deployment. This was achieved through the use of TravisCI and GitHub Releases. Whenever a change was made in any branch of the repository, TravisCI would create a temporary Docker container with Ubuntu 16.04 and Oracle JDK 11. It would then download all required dependencies - in our case, JUnit 5.5.0 and JavaFX, as well as Apache Ant 1.10.6. Ant is used for creating all build folders, compiling the solution, and then running all unit tests (which are stored in the src/tests/ directory). We would then receive a report (via email) of the testing and if any errors occurred. However, if the change was made in the "master" branch of the repository, TravisCI would run Ant's "dist" script, which packages the compiled Java classes in to a JAR file. This JAR file would then be given a version number (which during development was TravisCI's build number) and uploaded to GitHub Releases. Pull requests would also be tested against the "master" branch of the repository to ensure there would be no breaking changes.

\section{Software Architecture}

Add details about the classes that make up the project and how they interact.

\newpage

\section{Advanced OOP Practices}

Add details about how advanced OOP practices were used to develop the project.

\newpage

\section{Using the Software}

Add documentation for using the software (presumably documentation written for the
\\ designers). This needs to be comprehensive in describing all facets of the software.
