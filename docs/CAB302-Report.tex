\section{Statement of Completeness}

The solution includes the following features: 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Line} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Plot} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Rectangle} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Ellipse} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Polygon} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Pen Colour} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{Drawing - Fill Colour} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{File Handling - Read} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{File Handling - Write} & Still to be implemented \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Layout} & Complete - Tested Working \\
		\hline  \textbf{GUI - Buttons} & Complete - Tested Working \\

\section{Statement of Contribution}

{\large Alex Butler}\\
Alex implemented all of the Shape classes, as well as the Shape interface and enumerator. He also wrote the unit tests for testing each Shape class, and the first iteration of the GUI (mainly for testing purposes). 
\\\\{\large Bradley Fuller}\\
Bradley implemented the file handling classes, as well as the unit testing for said classes. He also wrote and configured the Apache Ant build script, and the TravisCI configuration for continuous integration and delivery to GitHub Releases.
\\\\{\large Joshua O'Riordan}\\
Joshua implemented the final iteration of the GUI, including the general layout, buttons, menu bar and colour picker. He also wrote the Undo History and Bitmap Export functionality, as well as the unit tests for both.

\section{Software Development Practices}

Add our development practices and cycles here. Describe how the team used Agile \\
Development Processes. If you used test-driven development, describe this here.\\
Otherwise, describe other relevant processes (e.g. iterative design-code-test stages).

\newpage

\section{Software Architecture}

Add details about the classes that make up the project and how they interact.

\newpage

\section{Advanced OOP Practices}

Add details about how advanced OOP practices were used to develop the project.

\newpage

\section{Using the Software}

Add documentation for using the software (presumably documentation written for the
\\ designers). This needs to be comprehensive in describing all facets of the software.
